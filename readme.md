# Polynomial Regression

## Project Description
This project implements a cusotm polynomical regression using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Install necessary packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
There are two ways to use the Polynomial Regression:

**Standalone Usage**:
1.Use the PolynomialRegrresion.py file

**Integration into Main Program**:
1. Make necessary adjustments to the 'main_progran.py' file to integrate the model into you workflow.
2. Note that the data pipeline in the main program assumes a csv file that is split into training and validation data
3. You should perform preprocessing on you dara before using it in this program.
